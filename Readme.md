#### The solver is coupled to the software packages:
  * [COSMO](http://www.cosmo-model.org)       -- Numerical Weather Prediction model
  * [DALES](https://github.com/dalesteam/dales) -- Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation model
  * [LibRadtran](http://www.libradtran.org)  -- all purpose radiative transfer Library(partially free)
  * [PALM](https://gitlab.palm-model.org/) -- PALM LES Model
  * [UCLA-LES](http://www.github.com/uclales/uclales)    -- Large Eddy Simulation code for cloud resolving simulations
  * [WRF](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) -- WRF-ARW Modeling System

#### Note concerning the usage
The code is distributed under the GPL, and you are therefore free to use, change and redistribute it.
I do however highly encourage you to participate in the development of the codebase.
If you are using the code in your work, please consider sharing bugfixes and experiences.
Given the experimental status of the solver, I kindly ask that you get in touch before publishing any results concerning the TenStream solver to ensure correctness of the results.
It would also be appreciated to discuss co-authorship for research publications conducted with the TenStream solver.

##### Further installation instructions and quick tips are available at the [TenStream-Wiki](https://github.com/tenstream/tenstream/wiki)

##### Prerequisites for the Tenstream solver are
  * cmake
  * PETSc
  * MPI
  * NetCDF

Instructions on how to install these is beyond the scope of this text.

#### The solver is currently tested and running at:
* Linux Cluster University Munich

You may find a hint for a suitable setup in the gitlab CI pipeline of the project

#### Currently the solver is tested for Compilers:

* GFortran
* Intel Compiler
* XLF IBM Compilers

If you found yourself go nuts because of compile errors,
please consider providing installation instructions
for your particular enviroment.
